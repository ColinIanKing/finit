1.4 (20121002)
	- Fix I/O plugin watcher and load plugins earlier for a new hook
	- Start refactoring helpers.c into a libite.so (-lite).  This
	  means other user space applications/daemons can make use of
	  the neat toolbox available in finit
	- Use short-form -s/-w -u to work with BusyBox hwclock as well
	- Use RTLD_GLOBAL flag to tell dynamic loader to load dependent
	  .so files as well.  Lets other plugins use global symbols.
	- Greatly simplify svc hook for external plugins and cleanup
	  the plugin API.
	- And more... see the GIT log for more details.

1.3 (20120928)
	- Cleanup public plugin API a bit and add new pid/pidfile funcs
	- Add plugin hook to end of service startup
	- Remove finit.h from svc.h, plugins should not need this.
	- Move utility macros etc. to helpers.h
	- Make finit.h daemon internal, only
	- Move defines of FIFO, conf and rcS.d to Makefile => correct paths
	- Add support for installing required headers in system include dir
	- Better support for distributions and packagers with install-exec,
	  install-data, and install-dev targets in Makefile.  Useful if you
	  want to call targets with different $DESTDIR!
	- Makefile fixes for installation, paths encoded wrong
	- Strip binaries + .so files, support for $(CROSS) toolchain strip
	- Default install is now to /sbin/finit and /usr/
	- Note change in $PLUGIN_DIR environemnt variable to $plugindir
